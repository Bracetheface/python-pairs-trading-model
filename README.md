Pairs Trading Strategy Analysis with Python

Objective
This project implements a classic statistical arbitrage strategy, pairs trading, from the ground up. The goal was to identify a cointegrated relationship between two synthetic financial assets, generate trading signals based on mean reversion of their price spread, and evaluate the strategy's performance through a simplified backtest.

Methodology
The strategy is built on several core econometric and statistical concepts:

* **Linear Regression**: An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was used to determine the **hedge ratio (β)** between the two assets, modelling the relationship `Stock_A = α + β * Stock_B`.
* **Spread Calculation**: The spread was calculated as the residual of the regression (`spread = Stock_A - β * Stock_B`). This time series represents the deviation from the long-term equilibrium.
* **Mean Reversion Test**: A simplified test was conducted to confirm that the spread is stationary (i.e., it tends to revert to its mean over time), which is the fundamental requirement for a pairs trading strategy.
* **Z-Score for Signals**: Trading signals were generated by calculating the rolling Z-score of the spread. Entry and exit points were defined by setting thresholds (e.g., enter at +/- 1.5 standard deviations, exit when the Z-score crosses 0).

Key Results
-Hedge Ratio (β): -0.239
-Model Fit (R-Squared): 0.23%
-Mean Reversion Rate: 64.23%
-Backtest Win Rate: 77.14%
-Total P&L: 6.10
